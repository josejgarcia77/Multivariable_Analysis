# Goals
The goals of this repository is to generate software/algorithms for the
computation of multivariable analysis invariants, operators, etc with an
emphasis on various spectrums like the Clifford Spectrum, Quadratic
Spectrum and related invariants. Although there are currently algorithms
that come off the shelf, the goal is to specialize the algorithm for specific
use cases motivated by physics paper.

At first most of the programs will be written in matlab, but at some point
they will be ported to either FORTRAN, C or C++ and ultimately in standard
numerical computing packages (very vague, but i'll figure out the detail later)

# Directory Organization
There will ultimately be directories as follows

* Clifford_Spectrum
* Quadratic_Spectrum

and more.
